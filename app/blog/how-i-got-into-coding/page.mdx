# How I Got Into Coding (and What I’d Do Differently)

I started college as a pre-med student. Organic chemistry, biology, labs—you name it, I was deep in it. But halfway through sophomore year, something didn’t feel right...

- Take intro CS courses earlier  
- Talk to more devs before switching  
- Worry less about “starting late”
