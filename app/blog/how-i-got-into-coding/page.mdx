# How I Got Into Coding

I started college as a pre-med student. Organic chemistry, biology, labs — you name it, I was deep in it.  
But halfway through sophom year, something didn’t feel right...

That winter break, I picked up a free JavaScript course. One thing led to another...  
and now I’m a developer building things I actually enjoy.

## What I’d Do Differently

- Take intro CS courses earlier  
- Talk to more devs before switching  
- Worry less about “starting late”
