        The Strange Joy of Inspecting Random Websites for No Reason

          Sometimes I’ll be scrolling on a restaurant site or an artist’s portfolio and think,
          “wait… how’d they do that?” And next thing I know, I’ve got dev tools open and I’m
          digging through nested <code>div</code>s like I’m doing digital forensics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not because I need to. Not because I’m stealing anything. Just out of curiosity. Just for
          the weird little thrill of finding out how someone else solved something.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll look at how they handle hover states. What fonts they picked. How many divs deep
          their nav is. Sometimes it’s super clean and I feel inspired. Other times it’s… not. But
          even that’s kind of fun.
        </p>

          Web dev can get so focused on output — the site, the result, the repo. But this is one of
          those inputs I quietly love. Just peeking behind the curtain of someone else’s logic and
          style choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve never done it, try it. Right click → inspect on a site that makes you pause, and
          just… poke around. You might find a weird hack, a smart pattern, or something beautifully
          dumb that still works.
        </p>

        <p>
          It won’t teach you React or land you a job. But it might remind you that under all the
          tooling, the web is still just a bunch of boxes, arranged by humans.
